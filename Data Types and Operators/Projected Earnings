# Real-Life Problem: Projected Earnings
# Question:
# Calculate the projected earnings for an investment based on the initial investment, annual return, and time.
# Take these values as input from the user.

# Answer:
initial_investment = float(input("Enter the initial investment: "))
annual_return_rate = float(input("Enter the annual return rate (in percentage): "))
investment_time_years = float(input("Enter the investment time period in years: "))

# Convert annual return rate to decimal and calculate projected earnings
annual_return_decimal = annual_return_rate / 100
projected_earnings = initial_investment * (1 + annual_return_decimal)**investment_time_years - initial_investment
print("Projected Earnings:", projected_earnings)
