# Real-Life Problem: Compound Interest
# Question:
# Calculate the compound interest for a given principal amount, interest rate, and time period.
# Take these values as input from the user.

# Answer:
principal_amount = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
interest_rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate (in percentage): "))
time_period_years = float(input("Enter the time period in years: "))

# Convert interest rate to decimal and calculate compound interest
interest_rate_decimal = interest_rate / 100
compound_interest = principal_amount * (1 + interest_rate_decimal)**time_period_years - principal_amount
print("Compound Interest:", compound_interest)
