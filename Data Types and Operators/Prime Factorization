# Complex Math: Prime Factorization
# Question:
# Find and print the prime factorization of a given number. Take the number as input from the user.

# Answer:
def prime_factorization(number):
    factors = []
    divisor = 2
    while number > 1:
        while number % divisor == 0:
            factors.append(divisor)
            number //= divisor
        divisor += 1
    return factors

num_to_factorize = int(input("Enter a number to find its prime factorization: "))
result_prime_factors = prime_factorization(num_to_factorize)
print("Prime Factorization of", num_to_factorize, "is:", result_prime_factors)
