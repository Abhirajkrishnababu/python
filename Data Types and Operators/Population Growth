# Real-Life Problem: Population Growth
# Question:
# Estimate the future population based on the current population, growth rate, and time.
# Take these values as input from the user.

# Answer:
current_population = float(input("Enter the current population: "))
growth_rate = float(input("Enter the annual growth rate (in percentage): "))
time_years = float(input("Enter the time period in years: "))

# Convert growth rate to decimal and calculate future population
growth_rate_decimal = growth_rate / 100
future_population = current_population * (1 + growth_rate_decimal)**time_years
print("Estimated Future Population:", future_population)
