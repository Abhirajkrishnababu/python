# Real-Life Problem: Currency Exchange
# Question:
# Convert an amount from one currency to another based on the exchange rate.
# Take the amount, initial currency, target currency, and exchange rate as input from the user.

# Answer:
amount = float(input("Enter the amount to convert: "))
initial_currency = input("Enter the initial currency code (e.g., USD): ").upper()
target_currency = input("Enter the target currency code (e.g., EUR): ").upper()
exchange_rate = float(input("Enter the exchange rate: "))

# Convert currency using the formula: converted_amount = amount * exchange_rate
converted_amount = amount * exchange_rate
print(f"{amount} {initial_currency} is equal to {converted_amount} {target_currency}")
