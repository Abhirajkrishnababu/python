# Real-Life Problem: Water Overflow
# Question:
# Determine if a water tank will overflow based on its dimensions and current water level.
# Take the dimensions, current water level, and tank capacity as input from the user.

# Answer:
tank_length = float(input("Enter the length of the tank: "))
tank_width = float(input("Enter the width of the tank: "))
tank_height = float(input("Enter the height of the tank: "))
current_water_level = float(input("Enter the current water level: "))
tank_capacity = float(input("Enter the tank capacity: "))

# Calculate the volume of water in the tank
current_water_volume = tank_length * tank_width * current_water_level

# Check if the tank will overflow
is_overflow = current_water_volume > tank_capacity
print("Will the tank overflow?", is_overflow)
