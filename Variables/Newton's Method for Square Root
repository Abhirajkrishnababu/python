# Complex Math: Newton's Method for Square Root
# Question:
# Implement Newton's method to approximate the square root of a given positive number.
# Take the positive number as input from the user.

# Answer:
def newton_square_root_approximation(number):
    guess = number / 2  # Initial guess
    while abs(guess * guess - number) > 1e-6:
        guess = 0.5 * (guess + number / guess)
    return guess

positive_number = float(input("Enter a positive number: "))
result_square_root = newton_square_root_approximation(positive_number)
print("Approximate Square Root:", result_square_root)
