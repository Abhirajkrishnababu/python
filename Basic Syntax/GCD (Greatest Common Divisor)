# Complex Math: GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
# Question:
# Find the GCD of two numbers. Take the numbers as input from the user.

# Answer:
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
result_gcd = gcd(num1, num2)
print("GCD of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", result_gcd)
