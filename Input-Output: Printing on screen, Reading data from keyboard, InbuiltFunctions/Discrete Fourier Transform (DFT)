# Complex Math: Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
# Question:
# Implement the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for a given sequence.
# Take the sequence as input from the user.

# Answer:
import numpy as np

def discrete_fourier_transform(sequence):
    N = len(sequence)
    n = np.arange(N)
    k = n.reshape((N, 1))
    omega = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * k * n / N)
    result = np.dot(omega, sequence)
    return result

# Example sequence: [1, 2, 3, 4]
sequence_dft = np.array([1
